***********************************************************************

ADDED:

Added ShapeMapper_MMS0_Mut_Filter.py. Filters SM runs performed with min mut
separation set to 0. Enables optimal base pair detection by PairMapper. See README for details.

Added --concat flag. This flag allows RingMapper to concatenate N1/3 and N7-G mut files and
generate N1/3-N1/3, N1/3-N7G, and N7G-N7G RINGs. 

Added alpha statistic calculation. Equivalent to 
(comutations / Depth) / 
((i mutations and no j mutations / Depth) * (j mutations and no i mutations / Depth))
(See 2024 N7 publication for a more in depth explanation / cleaner
formula). Allows for determination of effect size of a given RING.


Version 1.2

Anthony Mustoe <anthony.mustoe@bcm.edu>
***********************************************************************

-Eliminated need for mandatory untreated sample in pairmapper

-Eliminated default reactivity normalization in pairmapper. It assumed 
that users will use the Shapemapper2.2 --dms flag for processing for 
most usage scenarios, which properly normalizes the data. To reproduce 
functionality of prior pairmapper versions that perform internal normalization, 
use the --renormalize flag.

-Changed default reactivity filters to 0.2/0.4 for primary/secondary PAIRs
(prior values were 0.2/0.5). This is optimized for shapemapper2.2 --dms

-Changed default mincount to 10 (prior default was 50).

-Relaxed quality filters in pairmapper so that samples with lower mutation
rates and read-depths pass filter. This is based on eDMS observations.
However, further work on refining QC thresholds is needed.

Notable changes
---------------
Several modest changes have been made to the core RingMapper algorithm
relating to how positions that are observed in the untreated sample 
(background correlations) are treated/removed. Thus, for most datasets,
v1.1 ringmapper/pairmapper will yeild slightly different results. 
Benchmarking on the datasets published in Mustoe et al, PNAS 2019 revealed
that the v1.1 algorithm gives comparable result. These changes are briefly
summarized below:

-Previously, all nt pairs exhibiting correlations in the untreated sample
were masked from analysis prior to APC correction and Z-score calculation.
Because APC and Z-score calculation depends on all positions, masking prior 
to calculation can impact APC / Z-scores. Now, APC and Z-scores are computed
*prior* to background correlation sampling, removing dependence on the 
untreated sample. Note, however, that this comes with the tradeoff that strong 
background correlations can potentially skew APC / Z-scores.

-The minimum comutation count (mincount) needed to call a bg correlation in
the untreated sample was increased to 10 from 5 (increasing robustness).

-Previsouly, any i,j pair observed as significantly correlated in the
untreated sample was masked, irrespective of the strength of the signal
observed in the modified sample. This can cause undesirable behavior when working 
with very deeply sequenced untreated datasets, which can reveal a large number 
of weak (but significant) background correlations. Now, a test is performed
comparing the strength of background correlations to modified correlations,
and only background correlations that are similar in strength to modified
correlations are masked. Specifically, only positions with unt_MI > 0.2*mod_MI 
are masked, where unt_MI is the mutual information observed in the untreated
sample and mod_MI is the mutual information observed in the modified sample.


Other minor changes/updates
---------------------------

-A bug was fixed were nt Z-scores could be computed even if there was only 1
defined correlation for that nt. Now, Z-score are only computed if a nt has
at least 2 correlations defined.

-The default chi2 cutoff for calling correlations is increased to 23.9
(previously 20)

-Default mincorrdistance is increased to 6 (previously 5)

-By default, pairmapper .bp constraint files are written in pair format rather
than matrix format

-Read depth >400,000 is added as an automatic quality check in PAIR-MaP analysis

-override_qualcheck option added to pairmmaper to override quality filtering and
write pairmapper files despite failure of one on more quality checks

-added significantDifference function for computing differences between contigency tables
